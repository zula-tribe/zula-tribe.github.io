            <p>Zula is on a mission to enhance diversity and inclusion in children's libraries and bookshelves
                worldwide!
                Our goal is to create an inclusive online library for children's books, offering both open-source and
                premium subscription options. In this library, we curate a wide range of books that represent diverse
                cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. Our aim is to provide children of all backgrounds with access to
                high-quality literature that reflects their identities and promotes understanding and empathy.</p>
            <p>By offering an open-source platform, we encourage collaboration and contribution from authors,
                illustrators,
                and creators who share our vision. Together, we can build a rich collection of inclusive children's
                books
                that inspire, educate, and entertain young readers. In addition to the open-source content, we also
                offer a
                premium subscription service. Subscribers gain access to exclusive titles, enhanced features, and
                personalized recommendations, providing an enriched reading experience for children and their families.

                    They reflect who we are
                    and
                    what we stand for. Our desire with the project is to bring exciting, funny, entertaining, and
                    empowering
                    stories to as many children as possible. Families who cannot necessarily afford books should also
                    have
                    access to our books. This is achieved by making the texts available and free.
