        <h2>About Zula</h2>
        <p>Zula is on a mission to enhance diversity and inclusion in children's libraries and bookshelves worldwide!
            Our goal is to create an inclusive online library for children's books, offering both open-source and
            premium subscription options. In this library, we curate a wide range of books that represent diverse
            cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. Our aim is to provide children of all backgrounds with access to
            high-quality literature that reflects their identities and promotes understanding and empathy.</p></br>
        <p>By offering an open-source platform, we encourage collaboration and contribution from authors, illustrators,
            and creators who share our vision. Together, we can build a rich collection of inclusive children's books
            that inspire, educate, and entertain young readers. In addition to the open-source content, we also offer a
            premium subscription service. Subscribers gain access to exclusive titles, enhanced features, and
            personalized recommendations, providing an enriched reading experience for children and their families.</p>
        </br>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>Our values are the guiding principles that drive every decision we make at Zula. They reflect who we are and
            what we stand for. Our desire with the project is to bring exciting, funny, entertaining, and empowering
            stories to as many children as possible. Families who cannot necessarily afford books should also have
            access to our books. This is achieved by making the texts available and free.:</p></br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> We believe that every child deserves to see themselves in the stories they
                read. Inclusivity is at the core of our mission, and we strive to make our library a welcoming space for
                all.</li></br>
            <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> We promote understanding and empathy through the power of literature. Our
                books encourage readers to step into the shoes of others and embrace diverse perspectives.</li></br>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Collaboration is key to our success. We value the contributions of our
                community, and together, we create a rich tapestry of diverse children's literature.</li></br>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> We are dedicated to providing high-quality content that educates, entertains,
                and inspires. Our commitment to excellence is unwavering.</li></br>
            <li><strong>Growth:</strong> We believe in continuous growth and improvement, both as individuals and as a
                platform. We adapt, learn, and evolve to better serve our users and our mission.</li>
